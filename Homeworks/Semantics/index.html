        <h2>The history of the sitcom</h2>
        <p>
          Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the working title
          Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They presented the
          idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of
          the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including
          title changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was
          finally named Friends. Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in
          Burbank, California. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane
          Productions and Warner Bros. Television. The show ranked within the
          top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached
          the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on
          May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers,
          making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history
          and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s. Friends received
          acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular
          television shows of all time. The series was nominated for 62
          Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in
          2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50
          Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and no. 5 on Empire magazine's The 50
          Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 1997, the episode "The One with the
          Prom Video" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of
          All-Time. In 2013, Friends ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of
          America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time, and no. 28 on TV
          Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time. The sitcom's cast members
          returned for Friends: The Reunion, a reunion special which was
          released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.
